      <p>This Calorie Calculator is based on several equations, and the results of the calculator
        are based on an estimated average. The Harris-Benedict Equation was one of the earliest equations used to
        calculate basal metabolic rate (BMR), which is the amount of energy expended per day at rest. It was revised in
        1984 to be more accurate and was used up until 1990, when the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation was introduced. The
        Mifflin-St Jeor Equation also calculates BMR, and has been shown to be more accurate than the revised
        Harris-Benedict Equation. The Katch-McArdle Formula is slightly different in that it calculates resting daily
        energy expenditure (RDEE), which takes lean body mass into account, something that neither the Mifflin-St Jeor
        nor
        the Harris-Benedict Equation do. Of these equations, the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation is considered the most
        accurate
        equation for calculating BMR with the exception that the Katch-McArdle Formula can be more accurate for people
        who
        are leaner and know their body fat percentage. The three equations used by the calculator are listed below:</p>

      <p>The value obtained from these equations is the estimated number of calories a person can
        consume in a day to maintain their body-weight, assuming they remain at rest. This value is multiplied by an
        activity factor (generally 1.2-1.95), dependent on a person's typical levels of exercise, in order to obtain a
        more realistic value for maintaining body-weight (since people are less likely to be at rest throughout the
        course
        of an entire day). 1 pound, or approximately 0.45 kg, equates to about 3,500 calories. As such, in order to lose
        1
        pound per week, it is recommended that 500 calories be shaved off the estimate of calories necessary for weight
        maintenance per day. For example, if a person has an estimated allotment of 2,500 calories per day to maintain
        body-weight, consuming 2,000 calories per day for one week would theoretically result in 3,500 calories (or 1
        pound) lost during the period.</p>
      <p>It is important to remember that proper diet and exercise is largely accepted as the best
        way to lose weight. It is inadvisable to lower calorie intake by more than 1,000 calories per day, as losing
        more
        than 2 pounds per week can be unhealthy, and can result in the opposite effect in the near future by reducing
        metabolism. Losing more than 2 pounds a week will likely involve muscle loss, which in turn lowers BMR, since
        more
        muscle mass results in higher BMR. Excessive weight loss can also be due to dehydration, which is unhealthy.
      </p>

      <h2 class="headBright">Calorie Counting as a Means for Weight Loss</h2>
      <p>Calorie counting with the intent of losing weight, on its simplest levels, can be broken down into a few
        general
        steps:</p>
      <ol style="border: 3px solid black; padding: 5% 10% 5% 10%;">
        <li>Determine your BMR using one of the provided equations. If you know your body fat percentage, the
          Katch-McArdle Formula might be a more accurate representation of your BMR. Remember that the values attained
          from these equations are approximations and subtracting exactly 500 calories from your BMR will not
          necessarily
          result in exactly 1 pound lost per week &ndash; it could be less, or it could be more!</li>
        <li>Determine your weight loss goals. Recall that 1 pound (~0.45 kg) equates to approximately 3500 calories, and
          reducing daily caloric intake relative to estimated BMR by 500 calories per day will theoretically result in a
          loss of 1 pound a week.</li>
        <li>Choose a method to track your calories and progress towards your goals. If you have a smart phone, there are
          many easy-to-use applications that facilitate tracking calories, exercise, and progress, among other things.
        </li>
        <li>Track your progress over time and make changes to better achieve your goals if necessary. Remember that
          weight
          loss alone is not the sole determinant of health and fitness, and you should take other factors such as fat
          vs.
          muscle loss/gain into account as well. </li>
        <li>Keep at it!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The above steps are an attempt at the most basic form of calorie counting. Calorie counting
        is not an exact science, and can be as complex as you want to make it. The above does not consider proportions
        of
        macronutrients consumed. While there is no exactly known, ideal proportion of macronutrients (fats, proteins,
        carbohydrates) some balance is certainly advisable, and different foods have been found to have different
        effects
        on health, feelings of hunger, and number of calories burned. Generally, minimally processed plant and animal
        foods tend to be more conducive to healthy weight loss and maintenance.</p>

      <p>Consistent with the view that in regards to weight loss, only net calories are important
        and not their source, there exist cases such as the Twinkie diet, where a person that solely counted calories
        while eating a variety of cake snacks managed to lose 27 pounds over two months. As effective as this can be, it
        is certainly not suggested. </p>


      <p>Tracking calories also puts exercise in a quantifiable perspective, increasing a person's
        awareness regarding how much exercise is really required to counteract a 220-calorie bag of M&M's. Once a link
        is
        made between the amount of exercise that some snack equates to, many people find abstaining from that bag of
        chips
        to be the preferred option rather than performing an equivalent amount of exercise &ndash; which can lead to
        healthier eating habits. </p>
      <p>In the end however, what's important is picking a strategy that works for you. Calorie
        counting is only one method used to achieve weight loss amongst many, and even within this method, there are
        many
        possible approaches a person can take. Finding an approach that fits within your lifestyle that you think you
        would be able to adhere to is likely going to provide the most sustainable option and desirable result. </p>

      <h2 class="headBright">How Many Calories Do You Need?</h2>
      <p>Many people seek to lose weight, and often the easiest way to do this is to consume fewer
        calories each day. But how many calories does the body actually need in order to be healthy? This largely
        depends
        on the amount of physical activity a person performs each day, and regardless of this, is different for all
        people
        &ndash; there are many different factors involved, not all of which are well-understood or known. </p>
      <p>Some factors that influence the number of calories a person needs to remain healthy include
        age, weight, height, sex, levels of physical activity, and overall general health. For example, a physically
        active 25-year-old male that is 6 feet in height requires considerably higher calorie intake than a 5-foot-tall,
        sedentary 70-year-old woman. Though it differs depending on age and activity level, adult males generally
        require
        2,000-3000 calories per day to maintain weight while adult females need around 1,600-2,400 according to the U.S
        Department of Health.</p>
      <p>The body does not require many calories to simply survive. However, consuming too few
        calories results in the body functioning poorly, since it will only use calories for functions essential to
        survival, and ignore those necessary for general health and well-being. Harvard Health Publications suggests
        women
        get at least 1,200 calories and men get at least 1,500 calories a day unless supervised by doctors. As such, it
        is
        highly recommended that a person attempting to lose weight monitors their body's caloric necessities and adjusts
        it as necessary to maintain its nutritional needs.</p>
